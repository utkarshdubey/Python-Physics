# Python Physics

### Motive

The main motive of this project is to **create a program,
which accepts some values and returns the value which you want to find.**

*For example if you have an accelaration, initial velocity and final velocity of a body. This program will give you the remaining two values.*

If you have any questions please mail me at [hello@utkarsh.co](mailto:hello@utkarsh.co)

Please check the **TODO.md** file for the remaining tasks.

You can also pull *requests* and add *issues* if you want and collaborate in making this a better open-source.
